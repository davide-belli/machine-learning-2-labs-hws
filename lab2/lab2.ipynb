An elegant and efficient way to calculate these is using the n-way outer product of vectors.

In python, this is realized as `np.multiply.reduce(np.ix_(*vectors))` for a python list `vectors` of 1D numpy arrays. Try to figure out how this statement works -- it contains some useful functional programming techniques. What should `vectors` be? Try to see the link between the result and Eq. 8.66."

    "Write a function `sum_product(node_list)` that runs the sum-product message passing algorithm on a tree-structured factor graph with given nodes. The input parameter `node_list` is a list of all Node instances in the graph, which is assumed to be ordered correctly. That is, the list starts with a leaf node, which can always send a message. Subsequent nodes in `node_list` should be capable of sending a message when the pending messages of preceding nodes in the list have been sent. The sum-product algorithm then proceeds by passing over the list from beginning to end, sending all pending messages at the nodes it encounters. Then, in reverse order, the algorithm traverses the list again and again sends all pending messages at each node as it is encountered. For this to work, we initialized pending messages for all the leaf nodes, e.g. `X_prior.pending.add(X)`, where `X_prior` is a Factor node corresponding the the prior, `X` is a `Variable` node and the only connection of `X_prior` goes to `X`."
